## Introduction  
Network forensics is the process of monitoring, capturing, and analyzing network traffic to investigate security incidents, identify malicious activity, and recover critical information. This section covers network-specific forensics, including packet capture analysis, network log investigation, and the use of tools for deep packet inspection (DPI) and traffic analysis.

## Forensics Tools  
This section will contain tools specifically useful for performing **network** forensics. These tools can help you capture and analyze network traffic, detect anomalies, and investigate potential incidents.

## Resources  
A list of useful resources for **network** forensics, including software, research papers, and case studies. 

## Legal Considerations  
As with all forensics, itâ€™s important to operate within legal boundaries. Always ensure that you have the proper authorization before conducting network forensic analysis on any network or system.
