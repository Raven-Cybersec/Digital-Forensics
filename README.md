# Digital Forensics

## What is Digital Forensics?

Digital forensics is the process of collecting, preserving, analyzing, and presenting electronic data in a way that is legally admissible. It is a crucial discipline in cybersecurity, incident response, and legal investigations. Digital forensics specialists extract evidence from digital devices like computers, mobile phones, network logs, and storage media, enabling organizations to:
	•	Investigate cybercrimes, fraud, and unauthorized access.
	•	Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities.
	•	Support legal cases with technical evidence.
	•	Recover critical data after system failures or attacks.

## Why Digital Forensics Matters

In today’s interconnected world, where data breaches and cyber incidents are increasingly common, digital forensics plays a key role in helping businesses and individuals protect their digital assets. It helps uncover the “who,” “what,” “when,” “where,” and “how” of an incident, enabling informed decisions and effective incident recovery.
